Location App

## Description

This is a user-friendly location app designed to help you manage your saved addresses. Keep track of all your important locations, including home, work, and frequently visited places, for easy access whenever needed.

## Features

*   **Effortless Address Addition:** Add new addresses with minimal effort. Simply provide the house number, apartment number (optional), area, and category (e.g., Home, Work, Other) to create a clear and concise entry.
*   **Seamless Address Editing:** Need to update an existing address? No problem! Use the intuitive editing interface to modify any details, ensuring your saved locations are always accurate and reflect any changes.
*   **Convenient Address Deletion:** No longer need an address? Easily remove it from your list with a single click. This keeps your app streamlined and focuses on the locations you actively use.
*   **Search Functionality (Optional):** If you have a large number of saved addresses, quickly find the one you're looking for by leveraging a search bar (consider implementing this feature if your project scales).

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/LocationApp.git](https://github.com/yourusername/LocationApp.git)
    ```

    Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/LocationApp.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd LocationApp
    ```

    Install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    Start the development server using npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically launch the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application starts, you'll be presented with a user interface (UI) designed for managing your saved addresses. Here's a basic overview of how to use the key features:

*   **Adding Addresses:**
    1.  Locate the "Add Address" button or section in the UI.
    2.  Provide the following details for the address:
        *   House Number
        *   Apartment Number (optional)
        *   Area
        *   Category (e.g., Home, Work, Other)
    3.  Click the "Save" or "Add" button to add the new address to your list.
*   **Editing Addresses:**
    1.  Find the address you want to modify in the list.
    2.  Locate the "Edit" button or option associated with that address.
    3.  Make the necessary changes to the address details.
    4.  Click the "Save Changes" or "Update" button to apply the edits.
*   **Deleting Addresses:**
    1.  Identify the address you no longer need in the list.
    2.  Locate the "Delete" button or option associated with that address.
    3.  Confirm your deletion by clicking "Yes" or "Delete" (implement a confirmation dialog for safety).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The specific UI elements and actions may vary depending on your development framework and implementation choices. However, the core functionalities should remain consistent.
*   Consider implementing error handling and validation for user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience.
